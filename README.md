_The Exchange Money Project is a web-based application that allows users to convert currencies between four different currencies - PLN, EUR, UAH, and USD. The user can input the amount of money they want to exchange and select the currencies they want to convert from and to. The application then calculates the exchange rate and displays the converted amount to the user. The project is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes an external API to fetch the latest exchange rates. The project is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at `https://my-currency-validator.vercel.app/`._
